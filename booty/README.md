# booty


We have a need for running a service on each desktop and managing the binaries that are installed, like Decksh, etc. 

It is  designed as a Dev tool, so that all devs have the same dependencies, but there is no reason why it cant be used for the Users and us ( devs ): https://github.com/amplify-edge/booty
